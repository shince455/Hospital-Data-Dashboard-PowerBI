#  Healthcare Data Dashboard – Power BI

##  Introduction

This project features an interactive **Healthcare Dashboard** developed using Microsoft Power BI. It offers a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and provider insights for a healthcare center, enabling data-driven decision-making and operational transparency. The dashboard provides:
- Department-wise expense analysis
- Time-based trends across yearly, quarterly, and monthly periods
- Demographic segmentation by region and ethnicity

Key financial KPIs, including:
- Total treatment costs
- Insurance coverage
- Total patient billing

Designed to support healthcare administrators and finance teams, this dashboard empowers users to explore cost drivers, monitor provider efficiency, and optimize healthcare delivery through meaningful insights.

- **Time-Based Cost Trends:** Tracked healthcare expenses on a yearly, quarterly, and monthly basis to monitor spending patterns and seasonal fluctuations.
- **Demographic Cost Breakdown:** Segmented expenses by region and ethnicity, revealing disparities or trends in treatment costs across different population groups.
- **Financial KPIs:** Calculated and visualized key financial indicators, such as total treatment costs, insurance coverage, and total patient billing, for quick executive insight.
- **Interactive Filtering:** Enabled dynamic filtering across all dimensions (department, time, region, etc.), allowing users to drill down into specific data segments instantly.
- **Custom DAX Measures:** Utilized DAX to compute complex metrics including cost ratios, insurance coverage rates, and per-patient billing averages.
- **Data Validation:** Cross-referenced Power BI visuals with raw dataset using SQL queries to ensure data integrity and accuracy in reported insights.

##  Data Source

This dashboard was created based on a YouTube tutorial by the channel **Data with Decision**, and the dataset was obtained from the following link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EtNAUvnmik4yBdFy1_mvFMm3mV83eExQ/view

- The data was provided in Excel file and downloaded for the analysis purposes.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** was used for data manipulation, calculations, and the creation of custom measures within Power BI.
